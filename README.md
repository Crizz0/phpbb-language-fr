phpBB速 Forum Software
=====================

This repository contains the very latest build of the French language package compatible with the most recent version of the phpBB速 forum software to fully localize the forum software interface into French.

## Notice

It's strongly recommend that you do not download this package from any website other than this repository and the appropriate page on the official website of the phpBB速 forum software to ensure you will always have the very latest, virus-free version of the product.

Please note that development versions are generally not recommended and should be used locally, available for testing purposes only to developers or advanced and inquisitive users.
